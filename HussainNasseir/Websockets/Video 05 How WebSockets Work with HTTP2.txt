If there is HTTP 2 connection in the server configured , 
and we know that HTTP 2 uses multiplexing , 
So it uses multiple streams or rather channels 

If in one of the requests the client sends the UPGRADE header , to websocket 
Then that particular stream out of all the streams becomes reserved for websocket communication between and client and the server only 
On the same TCP connection , 1 stream/channel will be just for websockets , other streams assigned for post and put requests 

Tomcat 10 (not production ready for now) implements websocket 2.0 i.e. websocket over HTTP/2. Web Firm Framework uses websocket for all of its server client communication.
