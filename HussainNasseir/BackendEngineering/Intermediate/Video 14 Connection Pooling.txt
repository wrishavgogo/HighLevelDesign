Connection pooling in PostgreSQL is a technique used to manage and optimize the use of database connections in applications. It involves maintaining a pool of reusable connections to the database, rather than opening and closing a new connection for each database operation. This approach improves performance and resource utilization, especially in high-traffic applications.

Key Concepts
Connection Pool: A collection of database connections that can be reused by multiple clients or threads. When a client requests a connection, it gets one from the pool. After the operation is completed, the connection is returned to the pool.

Pooling Mechanism: The pooling mechanism handles the lifecycle of database connections, including creation, reuse, and destruction. This mechanism ensures that a sufficient number of connections are available for application demands.

Configuration: Connection pools are configured with parameters such as the maximum number of connections, the minimum number of idle connections, connection timeout, etc. These parameters help manage the pool's behavior and performance.

Benefits of Connection Pooling
Performance Improvement: Reducing the overhead of establishing and closing database connections can significantly improve application performance, especially in scenarios with a high number of database operations.

Resource Management: Efficiently managing database connections helps in optimizing resource usage, such as CPU and memory, both on the application server and the database server.

Scalability: Connection pooling allows applications to handle more concurrent database operations without overwhelming the database server
