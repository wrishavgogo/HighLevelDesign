Hussain literally showed using NodeJs and postgress how we can implement sharding 
There is a library in nodeJs called "consistent-hash" , which lets us do consistent hashing on the nodes we have provided 

Rest on sharding , we have read about it a lot 

Pros Of Sharding :

1. Scalability in terms of both Data and memory 
2. Security : User can access certain shards 
3. Optimal : Since partitions are small hence the index sizes are small 

Cons of Sharding :

1. Cross Shard transactions becomes difficult since 
2. Rolling back of transactions that too among multiple shards become difficult 
3. Schema changes are hard , as multiple servers need transactions 
4. Joins become very tricky , as there are network calls involved in querying multiple shards for joining 
5. If we don't know the key and we query on some other value , then we are forced to query all the shards
