Index Scan v/s Index Only Scan 

Lets take an example of a table schema 

Grades Table :

id |  name | subject | grade 


if we create an index on id , 


In Index Scan , 



create index(id) in Grades;
Select name from Grades where id = 7 ; 

Using the index table , it goes the index very fast , 
but name column is not stored in the index , so it has to go the reference row in the table  to fetch the name 
ETA : 1.245 ms 

In Index Only Scan , 

create index idx on grades(id) include name ;

this basically says to include the name column for each id along with the id , in the index itself 
so we dont need to go to the the reference row in the table 

Select name from Grades where id = 7 ;  

ETA 0.125 ms , because name is stored in the index itself
