Lets say that 3 servers , s1 , s2 and s3 .


Lets say we want to build a 100 % consistent and available server .

Imagine if s3 fails , and since we are wanting to keep our server Consistent and available , we do not check or fix s3 . We do not engage any server to communicate with s3 
to fix it . 
Now Requests coming to s3 are not handled and s1 and s2 dont have updated data .
Hence our system is loosing consistency anyway 

**** We cannot compromise on Partition Tolerance . We always need P 
Now we have to decide on Availability and Consistency . 

In Transactional Db : Bank Servers . Consistency is very imp . Hence Bank servers are down for sometime for maintainanace purpose 
In Other application , like streaming services : Availability is always very important . Some consistency can be compromised in this case
