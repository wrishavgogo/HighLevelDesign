Suppose there is a user and there is a newsFeed server 


Short Polling : 

The user sends a request to the user every 1 min , to get updates of the Euro Cup final 

User sends request -> if there is an update the server sends back a response 
User sends request -> if there is no update the server gets an empty response 

This is called short polling .


Long Polling :

Another scenrio is when the user Sends a request and there is no new update 
Then the server does not close the tcp connection . It keeps the connection open for a certain KeepAlive Time 
and when there is any response available , it sends it directly to the client .
If within the KeepAliveTime the server does not have any update , it sends a TimeoutException .

In Long Polling , we have reduced a lot of cycles and connection creation and we have increased the bandwidth from ShortPolling 

WebSockets : 

Bidirectional Connection , used for chatting or online gaming . 
We have connections open among the users and the server . 
The server can directly send message to client and even the client can directly send message to the server .
