Chaos Engineering is basically Stress Testing , 

My Application should be able to handle 20X more load then whatever is the expected load during peak hours

You Should aware of Critical and Non-Critical services of your system 

Lets take example of Netflix :-

Clicking on a movie and it should play : Critical 
Recommended Movies : Non Critical  


By Chaos Testing , we can check if our timeouts and configs are properly setup or not . You remember the walmart's chaos testing 
where they introduced Network delay and traffic was not moving out of the region which had delay . 
This was due to execesively long timeout set of readinessProbe and liveliness Probe with huge threshold 


We can have alerts and metrics configured to keep an eye on issues so that we can handle incidents before hand 


While we deploy anything , we shall be minimising the blast radius .
