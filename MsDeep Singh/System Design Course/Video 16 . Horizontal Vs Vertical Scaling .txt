Both are using Hybridly in today's world 


1. Vertical Scaling can have down Time , but not horizontal Scaling 
2. Data Inconsistency not in vertical Scaling , but present in Horizontal Scaling 
3. Resiclency and Fault Tolerance : Since point of failure in Vertical Scaling , but not the case in Horizontal Scaling 
4. Complexity :- Less complex in single machine in Vertical Scaling , but complex in horizontal Scaling
